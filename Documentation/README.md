# Assignment Compilation

### Compilation of all the assignments of the subjects in LaTeX format

You need to have a LaTeX compiler to compile this file.

You can do this very easily with MikTeX or LiveTeX. The detailed process will be described later on. The compiled books can be found under Release tags.
