## 6th Semester Labs

- **DBMS** 
* .sql filse for queries to get the desired output. I'll be creating a long sql file with all the necessary steps to create everything at once. I don't like small and many query files.
* I'll document the code properly. As in, I'll add a lot of comments describing what the queries do in layman's terms so that it's easy to understand.

- **Computer Networking**
* I currently have no idea how things will be for this lab. But I'll be sure to upload things what's being taught in the class.

I have also created a trello board to track our progress throughout the semester
